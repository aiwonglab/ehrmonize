Welcome to EHRmonize's Documentation!
=====================================

**EHRmonize** is a Python library designed to abstract medical concepts in electronic health records (EHR)
using large language models (LLMs). 

It offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API to facilitate the harmonization of complex EHR data,
aiding clinicians by significantly reducing the time required for data abstraction tasks.
